# huaweicloud_waf_rule_blacklist

Manages a WAF blacklist and whitelist rule resource within HuaweiCloud.

-> **NOTE:** All WAF resources depend on WAF instances, and the WAF instances need to be purchased before they can be
used. The blacklist and whitelist rule resource can be used in Cloud Mode, Dedicated Mode and ELB Mode.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "huaweicloud_waf_policy" "policy_1" {
  name = "policy_1"
}

resource "huaweicloud_waf_rule_blacklist" "rule_1" {
  policy_id  = huaweicloud_waf_policy.policy_1.id
  ip_address = "192.168.0.0/24"
  action     = 0
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The region in which to create the WAF blacklist and whitelist rule resource.
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used. Changing this setting will push a new certificate.

* `policy_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the WAF policy ID. Changing this creates a new rule. Please make
  sure that the region which the policy belongs to be consistent with the `region`.

* `ip_address` - (Required, String) Specifies the IP address or range. For example, 192.168.0.125 or 192.168.0.0/24.

* `action` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the protective action. Defaults is `0`. The value can be:
  + `0`: block the request.
  + `1`: allow the request.
  + `2`: log the request only.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The rule ID in UUID format.

## Import

Blacklist and Whiltelist Rules can be imported using the policy ID and rule ID separated by a slash, e.g.:

```sh
terraform import huaweicloud_waf_rule_blacklist.rule_1 d78b439fd5e54ea08886e5f63ee7b3f5/ac01a092d50e4e6ba3cd622c1128ba2c
