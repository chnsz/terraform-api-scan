# huaweicloud_compute_instance

Manages a ECS VM instance resource within HuaweiCloud. This is an alternative to `huaweicloud_compute_instance_v2`

## Example Usage

### Basic Instance

```hcl
variable "secgroup_id" {}

data "huaweicloud_availability_zones" "myaz" {}

data "huaweicloud_compute_flavors" "myflavor" {
  availability_zone = data.huaweicloud_availability_zones.myaz.names[0]
  performance_type  = "normal"
  cpu_core_count    = 2
  memory_size       = 4
}

data "huaweicloud_vpc_subnet" "mynet" {
  name = "subnet-default"
}

data "huaweicloud_images_image" "myimage" {
  name        = "Ubuntu 18.04 server 64bit"
  most_recent = true
}

resource "huaweicloud_compute_instance" "basic" {
  name               = "basic"
  image_id           = data.huaweicloud_images_image.myimage.id
  flavor_id          = data.huaweicloud_compute_flavors.myflavor.ids[0]
  security_group_ids = [var.secgroup_id]
  availability_zone  = data.huaweicloud_availability_zones.myaz.names[0]

  network {
    uuid = data.huaweicloud_vpc_subnet.mynet.id
  }
}
```

### Instance With Associated Eip

```hcl
variable "secgroup_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_compute_instance" "myinstance" {
  name               = "myinstance"
  image_id           = "ad091b52-742f-469e-8f3c-fd81cadf0743"
  flavor_id          = "s6.small.1"
  key_pair           = "my_key_pair_name"
  security_group_ids = [var.secgroup_id]
  availability_zone  = "cn-north-4a"

  network {
    uuid = "55534eaa-533a-419d-9b40-ec427ea7195a"
  }
}

resource "huaweicloud_vpc_eip" "myeip" {
  publicip {
    type = "5_bgp"
  }
  bandwidth {
    name        = "test"
    size        = 8
    share_type  = "PER"
    charge_mode = "traffic"
  }
}

resource "huaweicloud_compute_eip_associate" "associated" {
  public_ip   = huaweicloud_vpc_eip.myeip.address
  instance_id = huaweicloud_compute_instance.myinstance.id
}
```

### Instance With Attached Volume

```hcl
variable "secgroup_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_evs_volume" "myvolume" {
  name              = "myvolume"
  availability_zone = "cn-north-4a"
  volume_type       = "SAS"
  size              = 10
}

resource "huaweicloud_compute_instance" "myinstance" {
  name               = "myinstance"
  image_id           = "ad091b52-742f-469e-8f3c-fd81cadf0743"
  flavor_id          = "s6.small.1"
  key_pair           = "my_key_pair_name"
  security_group_ids = [var.secgroup_id]
  availability_zone  = "cn-north-4a"

  network {
    uuid = "55534eaa-533a-419d-9b40-ec427ea7195a"
  }
}

resource "huaweicloud_compute_volume_attach" "attached" {
  instance_id = huaweicloud_compute_instance.myinstance.id
  volume_id   = huaweicloud_evs_volume.myvolume.id
}
```

### Instance With Multiple Data Disks

It's possible to specify multiple `data_disks` entries to create an instance with multiple data disks, but we can't
ensure the volume attached order. So it's recommended to use `Instance With Attached Volume` above.

```hcl
variable "secgroup_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_compute_instance" "multi-disk" {
  name               = "multi-net"
  image_id           = "ad091b52-742f-469e-8f3c-fd81cadf0743"
  flavor_id          = "s6.small.1"
  key_pair           = "my_key_pair_name"
  security_group_ids = [var.secgroup_id]
  availability_zone  = "cn-north-4a"

  system_disk_type = "SAS"
  system_disk_size = 40

  data_disks {
    type = "SAS"
    size = "10"
  }
  data_disks {
    type = "SAS"
    size = "20"
  }

  delete_disks_on_termination = true

  network {
    uuid = "55534eaa-533a-419d-9b40-ec427ea7195a"
  }
}
```

### Instance With Multiple Networks

```hcl
variable "secgroup_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_compute_instance" "multi-net" {
  name               = "multi-net"
  image_id           = "ad091b52-742f-469e-8f3c-fd81cadf0743"
  flavor_id          = "s6.small.1"
  key_pair           = "my_key_pair_name"
  security_group_ids = [var.secgroup_id]
  availability_zone  = "cn-north-4a"

  network {
    uuid = "55534eaa-533a-419d-9b40-ec427ea7195a"
  }

  network {
    uuid = "3c4a0d74-24b9-46cf-9d7f-8b7a4dc2f65c"
  }
}
```

### Instance with User Data (cloud-init)

```hcl
variable "secgroup_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_compute_instance" "myinstance" {
  name               = "instance"
  image_id           = "ad091b52-742f-469e-8f3c-fd81cadf0743"
  flavor_id          = "s6.small.1"
  key_pair           = "my_key_pair_name"
  security_group_ids = [var.secgroup_id]
  availability_zone  = "az"
  user_data          = "#cloud-config\nhostname: instance_1.example.com\nfqdn: instance_1.example.com"

  network {
    uuid = "55534eaa-533a-419d-9b40-ec427ea7195a"
  }
}
```

## Import

Instances can be imported by their `id`. For example,

```
terraform import huaweicloud_compute_instance.my_instance b11b407c-e604-4e8d-8bc4-92398320b847
```

Note that the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition, due to some attrubutes missing from the
API response, security or some other reason.
The missing attributes include: `admin_pass`, `user_data`, `data_disks`, `scheduler_hints`, `stop_before_destroy`,
`delete_disks_on_termination`, `network/access_network`, `power_action` and arguments for pre-paid.
It is generally recommended running `terraform plan` after importing an instance.
You can then decide if changes should be applied to the instance, or the resource definition should be updated to
align with the instance. Also you can ignore changes as below.

```
resource "huaweicloud_compute_instance" "myinstance" {
    ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      user_data, data_disks,
    ]
  }
}
```

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following timeouts configuration options:

* `create` - Default is 30 minute.
* `update` - Default is 30 minute.
* `delete` - Default is 30 minute.
