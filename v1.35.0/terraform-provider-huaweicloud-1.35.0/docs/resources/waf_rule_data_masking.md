# huaweicloud_waf_rule_data_masking

Manages a WAF Data Masking Rule resource within HuaweiCloud.

-> **NOTE:** All WAF resources depend on WAF instances, and the WAF instances need to be purchased before they can be
used. The data masking rule resource can be used in Cloud Mode, Dedicated Mode and ELB Mode.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "huaweicloud_waf_policy" "policy_1" {
  name = "policy_1"
}

resource "huaweicloud_waf_rule_data_masking" "rule_1" {
  policy_id = huaweicloud_waf_policy.policy_1.id
  path      = "/login"
  field     = "params"
  subfield  = "password"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The region in which to create the WAF Data Masking rule resource. If omitted,
  the provider-level region will be used. Changing this setting will create a new rule.

* `policy_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the WAF policy ID. Changing this creates a new rule.

* `path` - (Required, String) Specifies the URL to which the data masking rule applies (exact match by default).

* `field` - (Required, String) The position where the masked field stored. Valid values are:
  + `params`: The field in the parameter.
  + `header`: The field in the header.
  + `form`: The field in the form.
  + `cookie`: The field in the cookie.

* `subfield` - (Required, String) Specifies the name of the masked field, e.g.: password.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The rule ID in UUID format.

## Import

Data Masking Rules can be imported using the policy ID and rule ID separated by a slash, e.g.:

```sh
terraform import huaweicloud_waf_rule_data_masking.rule_1 d78b439fd5e54ea08886e5f63ee7b3f5/ac01a092d50e4e6ba3cd622c1128ba2c
